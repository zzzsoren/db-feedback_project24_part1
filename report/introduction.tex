\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is get hands-on experience setting up a database in PostgreSQL and
looking up data in it. Furthermore the purpose is about to get feedback. The report
reflects and documents the work carried out by us \texttt(Denis and SÃ¸ren) in the project.

\subsection{Formulation of the problem}
Create a database and insert data, then query the data.

\subsection{Requirements}
The database should be deployed in PostgreSQL with appropriate commands
to create the tables, by taking into account and enforcing all the integrity constants.

About 5-10 records in each table.

The schema to be implemented is as follows:\\
\texttt{PRODUCT(ProductID, CategoryID, ProductName, Description)}\\
\texttt{PRODUCT\_CATEGORY(CategoryID, Name, Description)}\\
\texttt{SUPPLIER(SupplierVAT, SupplierName, Address, Phone, Email)}\\
\texttt{SUPPLY(InvoiceID, SupplierVAT, Date)}\\
\texttt{PRODUCT\_SUPPLY(InvoiceID, ProductID, Quantity, Value)}\\
\texttt{SALE(SaleID, Date)}\\
\texttt{SALE\_OF\_PRODUCT(SaleID, ProductID, Quantity, Value)}\\
\texttt{PRODUCT\_RETURN(SaleID, ProductID, Date, Quantity)}\\
\texttt{STOCK(ProductID, Quantity)}\\



\subsection{Scope}
There is not much to this project. Just create the database, and discuss the methods of retrieving the data
the assignment requires.
